                <li>Growing up I fondly remember acquiring a new game and it containing some groundbreaking fresh mechanic that I had to learn and that was apart of the fun</li>
                <li>Unfortunately the industry has reached a point where publishers dictate and influence the developers and has created an era of stagnation</li>
